# Understanding of Cloud Computing 

## Benefits of Cloud Computing 
- High Availablity: 
    - Highly available systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a long time. These systems avoid loss of service by reducing or managing failures.

- Elastisity:
    - With elasticity, you don't have to plan ahead of time how much capacity you need. You can provision only what you need, and then grow and shrink based on demand.
- Agility: 
    - The cloud gives you increased agility. All the services you have access to help you innovate faster, giving you speed to market.
- Durability: 
    - Durability is all about long-term data protection. This means your data will remain intact without corruption.

## Two Different Expeneses 
- Capital Expenditures(CapEx):Capital expenditures are upfront purchases toward fixed assets.
- Operating expenses(OpEx): Operating expenses are funds used to run day-to-day operations.

## CLoud Computing Models
- Infastructure as a Service(IaaS)
    - Building Blocks: Fundamental building blocks that can be rented.
    - Web Hosting: Monthly subscription to have a hosting company serve your website.
- Software as a Service(SaaS):
    - Complete Application: Using a complete application,on demand, that someone offers to users.
    - Email Provider: Your personal email that you access through a web browser is SaaS.
- Platform as a Service(PaaS):
    - Used by Developers: Develop software using web-based tools without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
    - Storefront Website: Tools provided to build a storefront application that runs on another companyâ€™s server.

## Cloud Deployment Models
- Private Cloud: 
    - Also called "on-premises"
    - Exists in your internal data center
    - Doesn't offer the advantages of cloud computing
- Public Cloud: 
    - Offered by AWS
    - You aren't responsible for the physical hardware
    - Provides all the advantages of cloud computing
- Hybird Cloud: 
    - Sample architecture for a hybrid solution
    - Highly sensitive data stored locally
    - Web application runs on AWS infrastructure
    - AWS provides tools so they talk to each other
